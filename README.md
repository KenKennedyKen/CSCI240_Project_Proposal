Project Proposal

Idea 1: a way to see what SnowBowl run you have the greatest chance of getting hurt on based on things like age, gender, ski/board, rental/owned, weather conditions, level of skill, group size, etc.
Example input: ‘ I’m 16  male going skiing on rental powder skis, with a group of three other friends, all expert level, all skiers, overcast Monday.’
Example output: Most likely to get hurt on XXXX location.

Input: Show me the runs most women get hurt on.
Input: Show me the day most head injuries occur.
Input: show me the month with most helicopter evac.
